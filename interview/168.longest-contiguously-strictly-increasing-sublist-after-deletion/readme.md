Given a list of integers nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous strictly increasing sublist if you can remove one or zero elements from the list.
Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [30, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 22]
Output
7
Explanation
If you remove 8 in the list you can get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 22] which is the longest, contiguous, strictly increasing list.
